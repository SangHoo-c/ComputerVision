There was the rules that I can only use the function which I made.  
That means I couldn't use a OpenCV library to implement image filtering, image transformation, etc.   
It was really tough for me.  
because I 've thought that implementing library is not my job.   
What I used to do is pulling good looking library and making a nice service.   
This class changed my thought.   
But it was not easy.   
In particular, implementing homography using the eye-point algorithm took a long time.  
Every task had a lot of implementations using mathematical matrices, which allowed me to become more familiar with Python while mainly using numpy.
